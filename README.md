Currency Converter Program Using C Language

  The Currency Converter Program is a C language-based project designed to facilitate currency conversions between three 
major currencies: US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR). The program takes user input for the amount 
to convert and allows the user to choose the source currency and the target currency. Based on these selections, the 
program performs the currency conversion using predefined exchange rates and displays the converted amount.
